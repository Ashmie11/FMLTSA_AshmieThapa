# MLTSA25_AThapa
-As an aspiring experimental physicist, I have  realized that handling and interpreting data is a significant part of my work. Analyzing complex datasets from experiments can be challenging most of the times, so I decided to take this class to gain hands-on experience with ML methods and tools for data analysis. I believe that mastering these techniques will be valuable in my research and will help me make more informed interpretations of experimental data.

-I hope to gain practical experience with real-world datasets and improve my ability to analyze and interpret data effectively using machine learning techniques. At the same time, I am also excited to learn how to apply these tools in my research and work.

-I am not very experienced in programming and machine learning methods, but my curiosity and eagerness to learn will help me in this class. With my physics background, Iâ€™m accustomed to working with data and solving problems, so my analytical skills will help me effectively understand the tools and techniques used in this course.
